# Pre-requisites

- Node.js (Testing using node 0.12.7). To make things easy I recommend using [nvm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nvm)
-[Ember-CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-cli)

# Running the App Locally

To run GitTrack, just do:

```
ember serve
```

Then open your browser, and go to `http://localhost:4200`

# Running the Tests

Tests are written in the [`./test`](./test) folder. Today the only tests that are being ran are simple 'ensure exists' tests. In the very near future we'll have component and integration tests. For now, I'm just manually validating changes.
